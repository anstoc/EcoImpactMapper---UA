This code is an extension of the EcoImpactMapper. The EcoImpactMapper is an easy-to use open source software tool for mapping human impacts on marine ecosystems. It is based on the additive human impact model suggested by Halpern et al. ("A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems", Science, 2008).

The source code in this repository extends the EcoImpactMapper by adding alternative model components (e.g. non-linear ecosystem responses) as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis functions. IT IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

Thus, if you don't need these new functions (i.e. you're just using Halpern et al.'s model as originally proposed), it is better to use the stable and well tested original EcoImpactMapper (https://github.com/anstoc/EcoImpactMapper).
